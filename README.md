# Flash-drum-simulator-V1
A python implementation for Vapor-Liquid (VLE) flash calculations for multicomponent systems using Antoine equations
Saturation pressure values are calcualated using Antoine Coefficent values obtained in the database have been sourced from NIST [https://www.nist.gov/] 

## Features
Currently supported for up to 6 components that are available within the database present 
Uses a Rachford-Rice solver for phase equilibrium calculations 

## How to run
